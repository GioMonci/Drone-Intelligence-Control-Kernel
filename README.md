## 💦 What is D.I.C.K.?

D.I.C.K. is a fully DIY drone platform:

Built from scraps, 
coded in caffeine, 
and barely held together by hot glue and zip ties, 
**D.I.C.K. will rise** — and hopefully not crash.

### 🌟 Why Use D.I.C.K.?

Because every great engineering project starts with:
> “How hard could it be?”

This is **D.I.Y. aerospace with maximum attitude**.  
No DJI software. No safety nets. Just raw, untamed D.I.C.K.

- 📍 GPS tracking (so you can find D.I.C.K. when it runs off)
